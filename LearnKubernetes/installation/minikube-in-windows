I am assuming "docker desktop" is already installed. 

#Check to see if virtualization is supported
systeminfo
	Virtualization Enabled In Firmware: Yes	-----> this should be Yes

#Install virtualbox 
choco install virtualbox

#Install minikube
choco install minikube

#Start minikube
minikube start

Note - If choco is not installed in your system then check chocloatey.org for choco

After this might be docker ps command wont work properly. If it doesn't work then follow below 2 commands

minikube docker-env		----> this command will create env, but still execute for loop given in last line in this output.
